summary: Monitors a list of blockchain RPC:s for data on block height and request latency.

  An easy deployment of a blockchain monitoring tool and database.

  The Blockchain Monitor charm sets up an InfluxDB database and a `systemd` service running a monitoring application. The service requests a list of RPC endpoints from an external source and then makes pre-defined JSON RPC requests to those endpoints. The resulting data is stored in the local database and can be visualized with a tool like Grafana.

  For any entity running nodes on a blockchain network, keeping those nodes up to par is important. Among the most important metrics are block height and latency, hence a tool like this is essential to see the health of these metrics on the nodes one is operating.

  This charm should be useful for anyone needing to keep check on one or several blockchain nodes.
